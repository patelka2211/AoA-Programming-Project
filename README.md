# Analysis Of Algorithms - Programming Project

## Project Setup and Execution

This project requires the Rust programming language to run. (Rust can be installed from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).)

If Rust is installed, you can run the command `cargo run --bin algorithm_testing` at the root level of the project. This will compile and run the code inside the `algorithm_testing/src/main.rs` file, which is the main algorithm testing file.

## Code Organization

The code implementation for brute-force and divide-and-conquer algorithms can be found in the `algorithms/` folder.
